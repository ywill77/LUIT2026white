Good morning — or whenever your coffee decides you’re awake.

Thanks for showing up instead of doomscrolling; that alone deserves a cookie.

Celebrate tiny victories: finding your keys, keeping a plant alive, and not hitting “reply all.”

Big wins are just little wins wearing sunglasses. Keep taking small steps, laugh at yourself, and if things go wrong, blame the Wi‑Fi.

Thanks — and if you left early, hope the cat videos were worth it.
